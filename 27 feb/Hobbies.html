        <h2>My Hobbies & Interest:</h2>
        <h3>Travel</h3>
       <p> Curiosity, courage, and self-organization. Traveling can prove you are not afraid of stepping outside your comfort zone and learning new things. And flexibility and adaptability are among the most important workplace personal traits.</p>
 <h3>Sports</h3>
 <p>It does not matter what sport you do. Exercising in general develops self-discipline, patience, and helps bounce back from disappointment. Team sports create opportunities to improve leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills, too.
</p>
<h3>Yoga</h3>
 <p>You might say yoga is a type of sport, but it is much more than stretching. It also involves concentrating on breathing and is a great way to relax your mind. And data shows a relaxed employee is less likely to leave their job.</p>
<h3>Dance</h3>
 <p>Dancing is not just fun. It is a social activity that teaches collaboration skills. It also boosts cognitive performance and helps to unwind.</p>
